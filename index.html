             <p id="p1" text-align="justify" >Known as Zach, I am the guy whom you see in the picture on the side. I was born in the year 1991 in the city of Mumbai on a Saturday morning when the world was just 
               waking up from sleep. Completed my school and college in Mumbai and got placed in a reputed engineering firm in 2013. No looking back since that day. Growing professionally 
               admist the challenges that stood on the way, life has beeen rough in its own way. Moved into USA in 2018. Worked as factory floor worker for a while before being rewarded with 
               an engineering job on the merits of my previous job experience in the same field. I currently live with my parents and sister. </p>
             <p id="p2">I love to spend my time in the gym, hang out with family and friends, learn to play musical instrument (beginner 
                for sure!) or nature photography. Being responsible to give back for what we get, I believe in charity work to the best of one's ability. </p>
             <p id="p3">Currently a part-time student at an Online Coding Course of University of Pennsylvania with an ambition of developing and broadening my knowledge and concepts in logic 
               and coding. </p>
